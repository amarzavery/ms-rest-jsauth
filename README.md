# ms-rest-jsauth
Authentication library for azure-sdk-for-javascript, written in typescript. This is a super thin layer over adal-js.

If you are writing a web application in **Typescript** and need to use ADAL for authentication, you can accomplish that by following the code in [Samples directory](./tree/master/sample).

The intent of this project is to bundle authentication functionality into Azure SDK libraries for Node/Javascript, provided by [AzureSDKTeam](https://www.npmjs.com/~windowsazure)
